# Commodore 64 BASIC Learning Journey

Welcome to this C64 BASIC re-learning project! 🕹️

It's 2025 and [Commodore](https://www.commodore.net) is back! (Retro enthusiasts will say it never went away. :D)

I grew up with Commodore, and my first computer was a Commodore 64. Then an Amiga 500, and finally an Amiga 3000, before Commodore went bankrupt. I hung on with my Amiga for several years, but time marched on and I moved on to a PC. Eventually I came to my senses and switched to a Mac permanently in 2009.

But now that the original Commodore brand has been revived, and a very compelling [Commodore 64 Ultimate](https://www.commodore.net/product-page/commodore-64-ultimate-basic-beige-batch1) is available as a faithful recreation of the classic, I've ordered one and am excited to revisit my roots as a teenage programmer from the 1980s.

As incredible as our modern computers and mobile devices may be, there's something magical about that era when machines were so simple, and they were designed not only to be used but also programmed by the average person.

I need to re-learn programming C64 BASIC, and dust off the old PEEKs and POKEs before I get my new **Commodore 64 Ultimate**. The OG basic beige model, naturally!

This repository contains a series of progressive lessons and challenges designed to refresh C64 BASIC skills. Of course, I'm using AI to generate lessons (currently using [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) via [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)).

## 💻 How to Run

You can run these programs using any Commodore 64 emulator.

### Web-Based Emulators (No Install Required)
If you just want to try the code quickly in your browser:

*   **[C64 Online](https://c64online.com/c64-online-emulator/)**: A full-featured emulator that runs directly in your browser.
*   **[Virtual Consoles](https://virtualconsoles.com/online-emulators/c64/)**: Another great web-based option.

### Desktop Emulators
For the best experience (and what I use for development):

*   **[VICE](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/)**: The gold standard for C64 emulation. Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## 🚀 Usage

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open your emulator.
3.  **Drag and drop** the `.bas` files into the emulator window (most support this).
4.  Or, copy the code and paste it into the emulator (VICE supports "Paste" as typing).
5.  Type `RUN` and enjoy!
